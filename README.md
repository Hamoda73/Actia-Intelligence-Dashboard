# Real-Time Electric Vehicle Battery Monitoring and Predictive Analytics System

A cloud-native platform for electric vehicle battery health monitoring, combining real-time telemetry processing with AI-driven predictive analytics. Built during an 8-week engineering internship at ACTIA Engineering Services.

---

## Overview

This system addresses critical challenges in modern electric vehicle battery management by transforming raw sensor data into actionable intelligence through machine learning and cloud computing. Traditional battery monitoring systems operate reactively, addressing issues only after they manifest as failures. This platform enables proactive maintenance through predictive analytics and real-time anomaly detection.

The complete implementation spans from IoT device simulation to cloud processing and interactive visualization, demonstrating enterprise-grade architecture patterns for industrial IoT applications.

---

## Motivation

Electric vehicle batteries represent both the most critical and most expensive component in EVs. Battery failures can result in:
- Unexpected downtime and maintenance costs
- Safety hazards including thermal runaway incidents
- Reduced battery lifespan due to suboptimal charging strategies
- Inability to optimize fleet operations without predictive insights

This project demonstrates how cloud computing, machine learning, and modern software development practices can solve these real-world industrial challenges with both technical excellence and business value.
